# GoFr Summer of Code 2025 Proposal
## URL Shortener with Insights - Template Track

---

## Problem Statement

**Title:** Building a Full-Featured URL Shortener with Analytics using GoFr Framework

**Problem Relevance/Interest:**
.
- URL shortening is a popular feature in contemporary web applications, but most available solutions keep users stuck on proprietary platforms with limited customizations and exposure of analytics. I am drawn to this project because it solves an actual problem and demonstrates GoFr's ability to develop production-level backend services.
- This project aligns with my interest in scalable web service creation and communication with modern Go frameworks. I am particularly thrilled about the analytics section since it involves real-time handling and visualization concepts that are crucial in modern backend development.

## Implementation Plan

### Planned Features/Deliverables

1. **URL Shortening Engine**
   - **Custom Short Links**: Generate short, memorable URLs like `short.domain/user123` instead of long URLs
   - **Configurable Length**: Users can choose how short they want their links (5-10 characters)
   - **Custom Branded Domains**: Use your own domain like `sksm.tech/user123` instead of generic shorteners
   - **Link Validation**: Automatically check if URLs are valid and safe before shortening
   - **Expiration Dates**: Set links to expire after a certain time (useful for temporary promotions)

2. **URL Analytics**
   - **Click Tracking**: Count how many times each link is clicked
   - **Real-time Statistics**: See live updates of link performance
   - **Geographic Location**: Know which countries your visitors are from
   - **Browser & Device Detection**: See what browsers (Chrome, Firefox) and devices (mobile, desktop) visitors use
   - **Referrer Tracking**: Know which websites are sending traffic to your links
   - **Time-based Analytics**: View click patterns by hour, day, or month to understand peak usage times

3. **User Management**
   - **Public/Private Links**: Make links visible to everyone or just yourself
   - **User Authentication**: Secure login system to protect user accounts
   - **Link Ownership**: Each user can only see and manage their own links

4. **REST API**
   - **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete links through API calls
   - **Analytics Data Endpoints**: Get click statistics and user behavior data via API
   - **User Management Endpoints**: Register, login, and manage user accounts through API
   - **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting how many API calls users can make
   - **API Key Management**: Secure access to the API using authentication keys

5. **Testing and linting**
   - **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (handlers, services, database) in isolation
   - **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system can handle high traffic without crashing
   - **Linting**: Use tools like golangci-lint to enforce code quality and consistency

### Development Phases

**Week 1: Foundation & Core Functionality**
- Project setup with GoFr, establish three-layer architecture.
- Design and connect MongoDB database.
- Implement core URL shortening engine (generation, redirection).
- Develop basic REST API for URL CRUD operations.

**Week 2: User Management & Analytics**
- Implement user authentication (registration, login, JWT).
- Develop user profile management and API key generation endpoints.
- Build the analytics tracking system for clicks, geographic location, and device info.
- Implement link ownership and public/private link settings.

**Week 3: Advanced Features & Security**
- Add support for custom short links, configurable length, and expiration dates.
- Implement security features like rate limiting and URL validation.
- Enhance analytics with referrer tracking and time-based data.
- Begin work on custom branded domain support.

**Week 4: Testing, Documentation & Polish**
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Use `golangci-lint` for code quality checks and refactoring.
- Finalize API documentation and project README.
- Bug fixing, performance optimization, and final project submission preparation.

## Architecture Diagram

[Download as PDF](architecture-diagram.pdf)


**Technical Components Breakdown:**

1.  **URL Shortening Engine (Service Layer):** Handles core logic for generating, validating, and redirecting short URLs, supporting custom aliases, configurable length, and expiration dates.

2.  **URL Analytics Engine (Service Layer):** Asynchronously captures and processes click metadata (geo-location, device, referrer) for real-time and aggregated analytics using Redis and MongoDB.

3.  **User Management (Service & Handler Layers):** Manages user registration, login, JWT-based authentication, link ownership, and API key generation.

4.  **REST API (Handler Layer):** Exposes RESTful CRUD endpoints for URLs and analytics, protected by middleware for authentication, rate limiting, and logging.

5.  **Data Persistence (Store Layer):** Utilizes MongoDB for primary storage (users, URLs, analytics) and Redis for high-speed caching and temporary event processing.

## My statement

This URL Shortener with Insights project represents an excellent opportunity to contribute to the GoFr ecosystem while building a practical, real-world application. The three-layer architecture will demonstrate GoFr's capabilities for building scalable backend services, while the analytics features will showcase the framework's data processing abilities.

I am excited about the opportunity to work with the GoFr community and contribute to building a production-ready template that other developers can use as a reference for their own projects. The combination of practical utility, technical complexity, and learning opportunities makes this project an ideal fit for my skills and interests.

I am committed to delivering a high-quality, well-tested, and thoroughly documented solution that will serve as a valuable addition to the GoFr template ecosystem.
